A Reqrutement Task


I'm not an mysql master so i've played around with a template database that I found. This was a time saving measure because i had lots of other tasks and interviews. I'm new to mysql and i regret not making my own database in SQL Server. All in all i can completely rewrite the task from scratch with SQL Server for the next week if needed.
